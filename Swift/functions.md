### Functions

1/Strictly speaking, this version of the greet(person:) function does still return a value, even though no return value is defined. Functions without a defined return type return a special value of type Void. This is simply an empty tuple, which is written as ().

2/Return values can be ignored, but a function that says it will return a value must always do so. A function with a defined return type cannot allow control to fall out of the bottom of the function without returning a value, and attempting to do so will result in a compile-time error.

3/An optional tuple type such as (Int, Int)? is different from a tuple that contains optional types such as (Int?, Int?). With an optional tuple type, the entire tuple is optional, not just each individual value within the tuple.
```
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int)? {
    if array.isEmpty { return nil }
    var currentMin = array[0]
    var currentMax = array[0]
    for value in array[1..<array.count] {
        if value < currentMin {
            currentMin = value
        } else if value > currentMax {
            currentMax = value
        }
    }
    return (currentMin, currentMax)
}
```
