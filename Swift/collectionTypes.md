### Collection Types

1„ÄÅIt is good practice to create immutable collections in all cases where the collection does not need to change. Doing so makes it easier for you to reason about your code and enables the Swift compiler to optimize the performance of the collections you create.

```
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

```

3/ + operator
```
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
 
var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

```

4/Because all values in the array literal are of the same type
